% b = BaseLine1(x,L,approach),
% Baseline wander extraction from biomedical recordings, using a single 
% stage of median or moving average filtering.
%
% inputs:
% x: vector or matrix of noisy data (channels x samples)
% L: averaging window length (in samples)
% approach:
%   'md': median filtering
%   'mn': moving average
%
% output:
% b: vector or matrix of baseline wanders (channels x samples)
